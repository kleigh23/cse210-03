# Jumper
Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time. Action! Thrills! A neverending barrage of words and letters blasting you in the face! In order to avoid overheating your graphics card with our awesomeness we've just created a text only game for now.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 jumper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- jumper              (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```

## Required Technologies
* Python 3.8.0

## Authors
* Kelley Robertson (Kelley created the repo, worked on "guesser" and "terminal_support" and finished cracking an issue we had on the way director was working. An MVP performance!)
* Cristian Avendaño (Cristian worked on "Parachute", and went along the code for proofreading and debugging purposes)
* Shanny López (Shanny was involved in the kickoff meeting and provided us with her insight and support from the start, but due to factors beyond her control she couldn't directly work on the code this time around.)
